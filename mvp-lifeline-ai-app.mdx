## 🧠 Built with Perplexity Sonar API

Perplexity Sonar isn’t just some fancy LLM. It’s the brain behind MVP LifeLine’s real-time intelligence—giving users raw, relevant answers when they need them most.

Here’s how we’re using it:

- **Dual Personalities.** One AI, two roles:  
  - **Career Coach:** Helps youth fix CVs, prep for interviews, find gigs, and stay job-ready.  
  - **Emotional Companion:** Talks like a real human, listens without judgment, and responds with empathy when users feel stuck, anxious, or just tired of life.

- **10+ Languages.**  
  Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, French, Arabic, Hindi, Spanish, Pidgin—you name it. Sonar handles it. No English-only gatekeeping. Every youth gets served.

- **Emotion-Aware.**  
  It reads the room. If a user says, “I feel broken,” it doesn’t respond with generic junk. It shifts tone. It comforts. It helps you breathe and get back up.

- **Task-Specific Flows.**  
  Sonar runs deep prompts for:  
  - Smart CV generation  
  - Gig hunting  
  - Journaling feedback  
  - Productivity coaching  
  - Money tips  
  - Mental resets  

- **Offline Resilience.**  
  No internet? No problem. Prompts are stored, sent via USSD/SMS, and processed through a Sonar micro-gateway. The user still gets intelligent replies. MVP LifeLine stays alive—online or offline.

- **Multi-turn Conversations.**  
  This isn’t “ask once, get one reply.” It flows.  
  *“I feel lost.” → “What’s weighing on you?” → “Try this simple shift today.”*  
  It listens. It follows up. It grows with the user.

- **Personalized Interactions.**  
  Sonar doesn’t treat everyone the same. It adapts by language, literacy level, mood history, and past choices. It meets youth where they are—and walks with them from there.

**Bottom line?**  
We didn’t build MVP LifeLine with AI just to look smart. We built it with Sonar so it can **listen smart**, **respond real**, and **support healing and growth**—at scale.
