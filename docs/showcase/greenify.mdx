The inspiration for Greenify stems from the growing need to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable living. With the rise of urbanization and technology, we wanted to create a platform that merges innovation with eco-consciousness. Greenify aims to empower individuals and communities to take actionable steps toward a greener future by leveraging technology to make sustainability accessible and engaging.

## Features

Greenify is a mobile application designed to encourage and facilitate sustainable practices. It provides users with tools and resources to:

- Participate in community-driven eco-friendly challenges and initiatives.
- Access a curated library of tips, guides, and resources for sustainable living.
- Connect with like-minded individuals through a community platform to share ideas and inspire action.

The app is designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and impactful, making it easier for users to integrate sustainability into their daily lives.

## Usage

After running the app in your own setup or through the hosted URL, the following steps can be followed:

### First Step: Greenification

|  |  |
|------|-------------|
| ![First Step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepjyotipaulhere/greenify/refs/heads/master/assets/images/ezgif-4647c5467e6dac.gif) | <ul><li>The user opens the app, which requests permission to capture a photo and access the user's location.</li><li>The user takes a photo of their space (e.g., a balcony), and the app automatically captures their coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude).</li><li>The image is sent to the Perplexity <code>sonar-pro</code> model to analyze the environment (e.g., balcony, roadside), sunlight exposure, and available space for plants.</li><li>The resulting analysis and user coordinates are sent to the Perplexity <code>sonar-deep-research</code> model to get real-time weather information, assess plant growth suitability, and receive up to five plant suggestions.</li><li>The API returns an analysis of which plants are suitable based on the location type, sunlight, and whether it's an indoor or outdoor space.</li><li>The API also provides a list of suitable plants based on sunlight and average weather conditions for the location.</li><li>Finally, the user can share these plant suggestions with other users in the same locality.</li></ul> |

### Second Step: Community Building

|  |  |
|-------------|------|
| <ul><li>The community screen displays nearby users and the plant suggestions they received from the photos they uploaded.</li><li>The user clicks the “Start Matching” button to get AI-suggested matches with other users based on similar interests, plant suggestions, and the potential for sharing resources.</li><li>The API suggests community groups for matched users based on shared interests and recommended plants.</li><li>Each community group shows the matched users and an explanation for why they were matched.</li><li>The app also explains how the community can positively impact the local ecosystem and promote economic growth.</li></ul> | ![Second Step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepjyotipaulhere/greenify/refs/heads/master/assets/images/ezgif-439e19e10fb6f4.gif) |

## Code Explanation

Greenify was built using the [Expo](https://expo.dev) framework, which allowed us to create a cross-platform application for Android, iOS, and the web. Key technologies and tools used include:

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo for building the user interface and ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Backend**: A Python-based service using Flask to handle data processing and API endpoints.
- **Perplexity AI**: Using Perplexity AI's sonar-pro and sonar-deep-research models to classify image, plant suggestions based on image and coordinates by realtime research, creating a community by matching users of similar plant suggestions
- **Design**: Using React Native UI Kitten for custom themes and assets, including fonts and icons, to create a visually cohesive and engaging interface.
- **File-based routing**: Leveraging Expo's file-based routing system for intuitive navigation.
- **Community features**: Implemented using React Native components and hooks for real-time interaction.

** Pydantic models **
```python 
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class Plant(BaseModel):
    name: str
    image: str = Field(description="Image URL of the plant")
    description: str = Field(description="Description of the plant")
    care_instructions: str = Field(description="Care instructions for the plant")
    care_tips: str = Field(description="Care tips for the plant")
    AR_model: str = Field(description="AR model URL for the plant")


class Answer1(BaseModel):
    description: str

class Answer2(BaseModel):
    plants: list[Plant]


class Benefit(BaseModel):
    type: str = Field(description="Type of the environmental benefit")
    amount: str = Field(description="How much percentage of improvement")
    direction: bool = Field(description="True means increasing, False means decreasing")


class Group(BaseModel):
    users: list[str] = Field(
        description="List at least 2 or more users with similar plant suggestions and how they can combine same job in term of place, activities and plantation"
    )
    description: list[str] = Field(
        description="Short description of how these people match with each other"
    )
    benefits: list[Benefit] = Field(
        description="How this combination helps benefit the environment with parameter, percentage value"
    )


class Community(BaseModel):
    match: list[Group]
```

** Image Analysis and Insights about the captured image using sonar-pro and structured JSON output **
```python
payload = {
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": f"Analyze this image and return short description of the place with respect to suitability of plant growth ",
                },
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": image}},
            ],
        },
    ],
    "stream": False,
    "response_format": {
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {"schema": Answer1.model_json_schema()},
    },
}
```

** Matching people with similar plant suggestions and interests and create a matching community using sonar-deep-research **
```python
payload_research = {
    "model": "sonar-deep-research",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a plant growth expert. You are given a description of a place where an user want to grow some plants. You are also given latitude, longitude and altitude of the user. Your task is to suggest at most 5 plant that can be grown by the user in that particular place according to average weather.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"I am standing in a place having coordinates [{lat}, {lng}] and altitude {alt}]. The place can be described as follows: {answer1}"
            "Suggest at most five suitable plants that can be grown here.",
        },
    ],
    "stream": False,
    "response_format": {
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {"schema": Answer2.model_json_schema()},
    },
}
```
