# 4Point Hoops – AI-Powered NBA Analytics

![4Point Hoops Dashboard](https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/003/442/047/datas/original.png)

4Point Hoops turns raw NBA statistics into **actionable, narrative-driven insights**. By scraping Basketball-Reference in real time, cleansing the data and routing context-rich prompts to Perplexity’s *sonar-pro* model, it lets fans, analysts and fantasy players *understand the “why” and “what’s next” – not just the numbers*.

## What 4Point Hoops Does

- **Player analytics** – season & playoff splits, shot-type breakdowns and performance radar for any NBA player  
- **Cross-era comparisons** – e.g. *Michael Jordan ’97 vs. Stephen Curry ’22* side-by-side, stat-for-stat  
- **Team dashboards** – standings, playoff-probability Sankey flows and KPI tiles that auto-refresh daily  
- **AI Explain & Similar Players** – one-click Sonar explanations of a stat line or AI-picked comparable athletes  
- **Basketball AI Chat** – ask an expert LLM anything about NBA history, rosters or projections  
- **Credit-based SaaS plumbing** – Firebase Auth + Realtime DB manage sign-up, Google login, credit wallets, admin tooling and feedback inbox

## How It Uses Perplexity Sonar

```python
# Inline “AI Explain” for a selected player/season
payload = {
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": (
                "Explain Giannis Antetokounmpo's 2021 playoff stats in plain English. "
                "Highlight shooting efficiency and defensive impact."
            )
        }
    ],
    "response_format": {"type": "text"}
}
explanation = client.chat.completions.create(**payload)

# Free-form chat endpoint
chat = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="sonar-pro",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an NBA analytics expert."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who were the top 5 players in PER last season and why?"}
    ]
)
```

- **Context packing** – the backend injects cleaned, season-filtered DataFrames into the prompt so Sonar reasons over *actual* numbers.  
- **Credit guard** – every AI call passes through `credit_required()` middleware that checks Firebase balance before deducting a point and logging the query.
